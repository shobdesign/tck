At some point he was moving every 6 months from Europe to South America. He can speak 4 different languages, although he says he can't master any of them. As a kid, he never got a say in his family's decisions when moving. Now, he would like to go back to Canada, since he has the citinzenship and he never got the chance to go back. He likes to choose who he wants to be. Sometimes he is Czech, sometimes Brazilian, but he feels mostly Chilean.</p2>

            <p2>'Keira' is half Latina and half European. She was born in the Caribbean and grew up in 4 different Latin American countries. She was frequently pointed out due to her skin colour, and was discriminated at times. She enjoyed the culture and traditions of the different cultures she lived in, although she could never feel attached to any –feeling rejected from some of her host countries wouldn't allow her. This cultural rootlessness made her feel lost and alienated at times. Now, she understands that her cultural identity is the sum of all of her experiences. The good and the bad.</p2>

            <p1>Third culture kids (TCK) are people who as kids were raised in a culture other than their parents' or the culture of their nationality. They create and live in a third culture that integrates their parents’ culture and their host culture(s) into a culture unique to the TCK’s experience.</p1>

            <h4>The TCK experience</h4>
            <p2>The TCK has no control over where they are raised yet they are affected by the change in environment. Parents of TCKs often do not receive training in how to handle culture shock, transitions, and repatriation successfully with their TCK. Their mobility experience denies them a sense of home, roots and the stable network of relationships. Which leads to not being able to adapt and develop an identity. Those who do not feel as though they belong are considered "culturally homeless”.</p2>

            <h4>In between worlds & 'Ideal' TCK</h4>
            <p2>It is like living in two worlds, feeling comfortable in one, sometimes in the other, but only truly comfortable in the space between. (Gardner, 2014) TCK usually finds acceptance and belonging with other TCKs.<br>Ideal TCK understands that each “life” shapes the bigger self-identity and is able to integrate those “lives” into a single persona. To integrate who they were with who they are while accepting each part as valuable.</p2>

            <h4>TCK and Loss</h4>
            <p2>Although it is true the majority of people experience loss in childhood, TCKs may be exposed to a significantly higher number of losses. Losses may include family, friends, culture, passport country, school, environment, belongings, relationships, traditions, and home. These losses may be unrecognised or minimised, but they may still affect the TCK’s ability to trust and develop long-term relationships. It may also lead to “unresolved feelings of loss and grief” and if these are not properly processed, their identity development may be affected. And they risk feeling alienated, helpless, and lost.</p2>

            <p1>Culture is key to identity, as it serves the deep psychological functions of reducing human anxiety and providing members with identity. (Mason, 2009, p. 133) Identity can be defined as “knowing who you are” and the relevant variables would include culture, environment, relationships, possessions, and values.</p1>
